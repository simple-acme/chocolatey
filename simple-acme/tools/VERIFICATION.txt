VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I (Wouter Tinus) am the owner of the simple-acme project. 

Package content can be verified like this:

1. Binaries inside the archives should be signed using a code signing certificate by the 
   SignPath Foundation. The build:(v2.3.1.1894) and commit:(cf7c8228b25a9d6a469ce2c1e18f613a6e7d8c9e) 
   should be reflected in the "Product version" field of the executable. The expected build 
   number and commit are also posted publically at https://simple-acme.com/download

2. Archives should match  with the ones posted on GitHub:

   x32: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.1.9/simple-acme.v2.3.1.1894.$2.$3.zip
   x64: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.1.9/simple-acme.v2.3.1.1894.$2.$3.zip
      
   You can use one of the following methods to obtain the SHA256 checksum:
   - Use powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
   - Use Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
