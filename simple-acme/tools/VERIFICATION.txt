VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I (Wouter Tinus) am the owner of the simple-acme project. 

Package content can be verified like this:

1. Binaries inside the archives should be signed using a code signing certificate by the 
   SignPath Foundation. The build:(v2.3.3.2009) and commit:(1e2abd9e922e1ab3499522866e99f7bc46126443) 
   should be reflected in the "Product version" field of the executable. The expected build 
   number and commit are also posted publically at https://simple-acme.com/download

2. Archives should match  with the ones posted on GitHub:

   x32: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.3/simple-acme.v2.3.3.2009.win-x86.pluggable.zip
   x64: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.3/simple-acme.v2.3.3.2009.win-x64.pluggable.zip
      
   You can use one of the following methods to obtain the SHA256 checksum:
   - Use powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
   - Use Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'

   These checksums are also posted at https://simple-acme.com/download (look for the "Full" builds)
