VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I (Wouter Tinus) am the owner of the simple-acme project. 

Package content can be verified like this:

1. Binaries inside the archive should be signed using a certificate by the SignPath Foundation. 

   The build:(v2.3.1.1894)v2.3.1.1934) and commit:(bsdflsdf) should be reflected in the "Product version" 
   field of the executable properties. The expected build number and commit are posted publically 
   at https://simple-acme.com/download

2. Archives should match 1:1 with the ones posted on GitHub:

   x32: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.0.1826/simple-acme.v2.3.0.1826.win-x86.pluggable.zip
   x64: https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.0.1826/simple-acme.v2.3.0.1826.win-x64.pluggable.zip
