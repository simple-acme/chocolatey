VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I (Wouter Tinus) am the owner of the simple-acme project. 

Package content can be verified like this:

1. Binaries inside the archives should be signed using a code signing certificate by the 
   SignPath Foundation. The build:(v2.3.1.1894) and commit:(cf7c8228b25a9d6a469ce2c1e18f613a6e7d8c9e) 
   should be reflected in the "Product version" field of the .dll file starting with PKISharp. 
   The expected build number and commit are also posted publically at https://simple-acme.com/download

2. Archives should match with the one posted on GitHub:

   https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/releases/download/v2.3.1.9/plugin.validation.dns.azure.v2.3.1.1894.zip
      
   You can use one of the following methods to obtain the SHA256 checksum:
   - Use powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
   - Use Chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'

   checksum: a62b5d4cfb227f02e2feb08537ec2bed9fbd4fa9f69eea69239cbb1d67955305
